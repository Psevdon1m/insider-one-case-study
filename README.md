# Horse Race Simulation — Frontend Developer Case Study

A Vue 3 desktop application that simulates a 6-round horse racing game with 20 horses, condition tracking, and a modular DDD-inspired architecture. Built with Composition API, TypeScript, Pinia, Vue Router, Tailwind CSS, and delivered as a PWA with E2E tests and GitHub Pages deployment.

## Requirements Met

| Requirement               | Implementation                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **20 horses**             | Pool of 20 horses with unique names and colors              |
| **Unique colors**         | Each horse has a distinct color (domain-driven generation)  |
| **Condition score 1–100** | Horse condition stored and displayed; degrades after rounds |
| **6 rounds**              | Exactly 6 rounds per race                                   |
| **10 horses per round**   | 10 random horses selected from the 20 for each round        |
| **Round distances**       | Round 1: 1200 m → Round 6: 2200 m (200 m step)              |

**Round distances (meters):**

- Round 1: 1200
- Round 2: 1400
- Round 3: 1600
- Round 4: 1800
- Round 5: 2000
- Round 6: 2200

## Project Architecture

The app uses a **lite DDD-style** structure with two main layers:

### `src/core`

Shared application shell and cross-cutting concerns:

- **`components/shared`** — e.g. `MobileNotSupported.vue` (desktop-only cover)
- **`components/ui`** — reusable UI: `BaseButton`, `BaseHeader`, `CountDown`, `HorseSilhouette`
- **`composables`** — e.g. `useWindowResize` for viewport/resize tracking
- **`router`** — global router that merges base routes with module routes

### `src/modules`

Feature modules. Currently:

- **`race`** — horse racing game

Each module can contain:

- **`composables`** — domain logic (e.g. `useRace`: progress, speed, condition, tireness)
- **`components`** — feature-specific UI
- **`domain`** — types, constants, horse generation (names, colors), round distances
- **`routes`** — route definitions for the module
- **`store`** — Pinia store (e.g. `horseStore`: horses, program, results, actions)
- **`views`** — page-level components (e.g. `Dashboard.vue`)

This keeps features isolated and makes it easy to add or change functionality without touching the rest of the app.

## Features

### Core Game

- 20 horses with unique names and colors; condition 1–100.
- 6 rounds with distances 1200 m → 2200 m (200 m steps).
- 10 random horses per round; program generation and round-by-round execution.
- **Reset race** after all 6 rounds.

### UX & Visuals

- **Desktop-only**: mobile detection shows a cover (`MobileNotSupported`) instead of the game.
- **Animations**: running horse during race; standing horse when paused/finished/not started.
- **Horse list**: border highlight for the 10 horses selected in the current round.
- **Condition feedback**: after a round, horses that ran show a red marker and arrow next to their condition to indicate decrease.

### Logic & Data

- **Last-horse distance**: while racing, distance covered by the slowest horse is derived from min progress and speed.
- **Fastest horse speed**: displayed in km/h from speed and distance.
- **Tireness**: after each round, random tireness is applied and condition of horses that ran is decreased.

### Developer Experience

- **Auto-imports**: Vue APIs (`ref`, `computed`, `watch`, etc.), Pinia helpers, composables, stores, and all components from `src/core/components` and `src/modules/**/components` — no manual imports for these.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 22.x (e.g. 22.14.0)
- **npm** (or use the project’s lockfile with `npm ci`)

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Development
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in the terminal). Base path for production/GitHub Pages is `/insider-one-case-study/`.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is in `dist/`. Preview with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Scripts

| Script                 | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`          | Start Vite dev server                    |
| `npm run build`        | Type-check (`vue-tsc -b`) and Vite build |
| `npm run preview`      | Serve `dist` (e.g. port 5173)            |
| `npm run cypress:open` | Open Cypress UI                          |
| `npm run cypress:run`  | Run Cypress E2E (Chrome)                 |

---

## Testing

E2E tests are in **Cypress** under `cypress/e2e/`.

### Coverage

1. **Dashboard loading** — race dashboard loads; horse list is present.
2. **Horse display** — all 20 horses rendered; name and condition visible.
3. **Program generation** — button generates program; 10 horses per round; silhouettes on track.
4. **Race start** — start button shows track; horses move (CSS `left` changes).
5. **Single round completion** — wait for first round to finish; results table has 10 horses for that round.

Custom commands (e.g. in `cypress/e2e/support/commands.ts`) are used for: `visitRaceDashboard`, `generateProgram`, `startRace`, `waitForRoundCompletion`, etc.

### Run tests

```bash
# Interactive
npm run cypress:open

# Headless (Chrome)
npm run cypress:run
```

---

## CI/CD & Deployment

**Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/main.yaml`

- **Triggers:** push to `main` or `development`.

### Pipeline

1. **Install job**
   - Node 22, `npm ci`, single **build**.
   - **Artifact:** `dist` (build output).

2. **Test jobs (parallel)**
   - **Chrome** and **Firefox** both use the same build artifact (no rebuild).
   - Serve app with `npm run preview`, wait for `http://localhost:5173/insider-one-case-study/`.
   - Run all specs under `cypress/e2e/**`.
   - Upload Cypress videos/screenshots as artifacts.

3. **Deploy job**
   - Runs only on **main**, after both browser tests pass.
   - Uses **GitHub Pages** environment.
   - Deploys the same `dist` artifact to Pages.

Result: one build, parallel Chrome + Firefox tests, then deploy on success.

## PWA & Offline

The app is a **Progressive Web App**:

- **`public/manifest.webmanifest`** — name, icons, display, etc., so the app can be installed on desktop.
- **`public/sw.js`** — service worker that caches critical assets so the app works **offline** after first load.
- **`src/core/registerSW.ts`** — registers the service worker in the app.

Users can install the race simulation as an app and use it with cached resources when offline.
